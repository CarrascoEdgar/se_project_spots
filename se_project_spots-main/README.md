## Technoligies and skills used

- HTML
- CSS
- Responsive Designs
- Grid Layout
- Flexbox Layout
- Grid-template-columns: was used as repeat and we auto-fitted them with the width in order to duplicate new blocks with the same dimensions instead of individually doing them ourselves.
- List-style-type: so we can get rid of the bullet points that it auto-generates.
- Gap: Was used for the spaces between the cards in both the rows and columns instead of padding or margin. This was its even and it's added to the parent block and the child inherits them.
- Display: block was used for the card images to prevent them from moving.
- Word wraping was used for the titles. As to hide the the eccess words and add ellipes to them.
- Object fit: was chosen so the image would cover the area it needs to according to dimensions. Also this was the better option as some of the other would stretch it or have it repeat itself.
